## Description, Setup, and Installation

This program serves as a way to save time when creating a high-quality README file for any project! It utilizes a node environment and the node extension Inquirer to present users with a series of prompts that will accept a mix of inputs, checked options, and a selected variable to generate a sophisticated and well divised explanation for the functionality of any application. It also provides a tabe of contents that will allow any reader to quickly navigate through the README itself.

In order to set up and run the README generator, simply initialize node, install the dependencies via "npm install/npm i" and run the command "npm index.js" at the correct file path.

## Usage
